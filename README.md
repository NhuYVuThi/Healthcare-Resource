**Project Description**

**Introduction**
This project aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the distribution of healthcare facilities in the United States, including information on bed capacity, operational status of facilities, and the population served. The primary goal is to support efficient resource allocation and healthcare planning.
Summary
By analyzing data from healthcare facilities, this project offers valuable insights that can guide decision-making related to the management and allocation of resources within the healthcare sector.
Research Questions or Objectives
1.	Which ownership types dominate the healthcare facilities in the United States?
2.	How do operational status and bed occupancy rates impact resource allocation in healthcare?
3.	What is the effect of facility type distribution on the ability to serve the population?


**Data Source**

  •	The data has been collected from HIFLD (arcgis.com), containing information about healthcare facilities for the elderly.
Data Format

  •	The dataset is in CSV format and includes details such as facility name, address, city, state, facility type, operational status, bed capacity, and population served.
Methodology and Techniques

Tools Used:

  •	Excel: Utilized for data cleaning and preprocessing.
  
  •	Power BI: Employed for data visualization.
  
Process:
1.	Initial data inspection and cleaning (verifying data types, row and column counts, checking for duplicates and null values).
2.	Addressing outliers and logical issues within the data.
3.	Conducting analysis and making decisions based on the cleaned dataset.

**Analysis and Results**

Healthcare Facility Distribution:
•	Analysis results indicate that the Southern and Midwest regions exhibit a higher density of healthcare facilities compared to other areas.
•	The highest bed occupancy rate was recorded in the Northeast (95.37%), followed by the Midwest (87.12%).
Dashboard or Visuals: A dashboard created in Power BI displays bed counts, occupancy rates, and distribution across different regions. This dashboard provides a clear and interactive method for monitoring the status and allocation of resources within the U.S. healthcare system.
Overview of Dashboard:
•	Title: "Healthcare Resource Dashboard" – designed to provide an overview of healthcare resources.
•	Regions: Allows selection among various regions, including the Midwest, Northeast, South, Southeast, U.S. territories, and West.
Key Metrics:
1.	Total Healthcare Facilities (6696): This metric indicates the overall number of healthcare establishments in the region.
2.	Number of States (55) and Cities (3164): Provides geographical context for the number of facilities.
3.	Population (986K): Reflects the total population in this region, which can help determine healthcare needs.
4.	Total Bed Capacity (986K): This metric shows the patient accommodation capability of healthcare facilities.
Ownership Distribution:

  •	A pie chart illustrates the distribution of ownership types:
o	Government: 0.5K (7.5%)
o	Government-Dist.: 0.52K (7.72%)
o	Proprietary: 1.98K (29.6%)
o	Non-profit: 3.4K (50.78%)
This shows that the majority of healthcare facilities are non-profit, indicating a trend towards the development of community-oriented healthcare services.

Classification by Facility Type:

  •	A chart displays population distribution across various healthcare types, including:
o	General acute care
o	Psychiatric
o	Critical access
o	Long-term care
o	Rehabilitation
o	Children
o	Military
o	Special
o	Women
o	Chronic disease
This provides insights into the healthcare needs of different population groups.

Facility Status:

  •	A table enumerates healthcare facilities by specialty, indicating the number of closed and open facilities:
o	Total Facilities: 6696
o	Number of facilities closed and opened by specialty.

Helipad Distribution:

  •	A chart detailing the presence of helipads at healthcare facilities, categorized by size (Large, Medium-large, Small, Small-medium). This data can influence emergency service accessibility.
  
General Analysis:

  •	Accessibility: The number of beds and healthcare facilities must meet the needs of the population of 986K.
  
  •	Operational Status: Monitoring the number of closed facilities is essential for understanding the sustainability of healthcare services in the region.
  
  •	Helipad Distribution: The presence of helipads may impact patient transportation and emergency response capabilities.

_Findings_

  1.	Distribution of Healthcare Facilities: 
o	The Southern and Midwest regions have a higher density of healthcare facilities compared to other areas, suggesting these regions may have greater healthcare needs or better opportunities for establishing new facilities.

  2.	Bed Occupancy Rates:
o	The highest bed occupancy rate in the Northeast (95.37%) indicates significant pressure on healthcare facilities in this region. Conversely, the Midwest, with an occupancy rate of 87.12%, remains high but is less critical than the Northeast.

  3.	Ownership Distribution:
o	Over 50% of healthcare facilities are non-profit, reflecting a positive trend in developing community-focused healthcare services that can enhance access and service quality.

  4.	Healthcare Needs for Population Groups:
o	Classification charts reveal a diverse range of healthcare needs, from general acute care to specialized services for children, military, and chronic diseases. This underscores the necessity for flexible healthcare policies that adapt to the specific needs of various population groups.

  5.	Facility Status:
o	Monitoring the number of closed facilities is vital, as an increase in closures may indicate declining service provision, necessitating timely interventions to prevent service shortages.

  6.	Helipad Distribution:
o	The presence of helipads at healthcare facilities can significantly impact patient accessibility and transportation during emergencies, emphasizing the importance of these infrastructures in improving response times.

_Recommendations_

  1.	Develop Healthcare Facilities in Underserved Areas:
o	Consider expanding healthcare facilities in the Northeast, where bed occupancy rates are high, to address the growing demand for care.
  2.	Invest in Specialized Care Services:
o	Allocate resources to enhance specialized services for children, chronic diseases, and mental health to improve care quality and meet diverse population needs.
  3.	Support for Closed Facilities:
o	Implement policies and financial assistance for facilities that have closed to encourage reactivation and mitigate service shortages.
  4.	Continuous Monitoring and Data Analysis:
o	Establish a robust monitoring system to continuously analyze the operational status of healthcare facilities, allowing for early detection of issues and timely policy adjustments.
  5.	Enhance Emergency Accessibility:
o	Promote the construction of helipads at large healthcare facilities, particularly in areas with high patient volumes, to ensure rapid transportation during emergencies.
  6.	Strategic Long-term Planning:
o	Develop a long-term strategic plan for healthcare infrastructure that aligns with the increasing elderly population and future healthcare demands.
